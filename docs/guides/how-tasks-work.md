# How tasks work

This guide outlines how Quailrunner runs the tasks that you create.

### First, we look for rows.

Every ten seconds, Quailrunner scans the DB table associated with your task using the SQL predicate that you wrote to retrieve all qualified rows where we have not yet run this task. For example, if you wrote this SQL predicate:

```sql
SELECT uuid AS entity_pk, email
FROM public.users
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

we would scan your `public.users` table for all rows where `deleted_at IS NULL`, AND where we have not already run this particular task yet.

> **Notes on writing your SQL predicates**
>
> - You _must_ `SELECT` the primary key of your table and rename it in your query to `entity_pk` â€” it should look something like this: `SELECT primary_key AS entity_pk FROM "schema"."tableName";`
> - Other than that, you are free to `SELECT` any other columns on any other tables you are able to join to the primary entity table.
> - Remember that this query will be hitting _your_ database, so only use PostgreSQL features that your version of Postgres supports.

### Next, we perform the action.

At the moment, the only action available for Quailrunner tasks is a custom webhook. When we find qualified rows, we will send one `POST` request per row to your specified endpoint.

We send the following authentication header with each request. You can find your unique organization UUID in the task creation form.

```
X-Quail-Task-Secret: <your-unique-uuid>
```

We also allow you to send custom headers and a custom body as you wish, which means that you can easily integrate third-party APIs directly into Quailrunner.

When constructing your request body, you can use static values and/or any of the columns that you `SELECT` in your SQL predicate. To use columns from your database, use the following syntax:

```js
{
  "field1": "{{.column1Name}}",
  "field2": "{{.column2Name}}"
}
```

Make sure to respond to our request with a `200` status code - otherwise, our task runner will simply retry it.

### Finally, we record each run result.

If the action succeeded, we record the result of the run and we mark the row as `completed`. No more runs will be attempted on that row.

If the action failed, we automatically retry the row up to 5 times before marking the row as `failed`. If a row is marked as `failed`, you can queue it up for additional retries via your dashboard.
